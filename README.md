# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/]((http://localhost:5173/)) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Star Wars Character Viewer
This React application fetches and displays a list of Star Wars characters from the Star Wars API and provides various features for interacting with the data. The application includes pagination, a search and filter system, a dark/light mode toggle, authentication, and more.

### Features
Character Display: Show each character as a card with a random image.
Pagination: Navigate through character data with infinite scrolling.
Search & Filter: Search characters by name and filter by homeworld, film, or species.
Character Details Modal: View detailed information about a character in a modal.
Authentication: Mock JWT authentication with login and logout.
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light mode themes.
Performance Optimization: Includes lazy loading of images and caching.
Error Handling: Displays loading indicators and handles API errors.
Accessibility: Ensures the app is usable for all users with ARIA labels and focus management.
Testing: Includes integration tests to ensure correct functionality.

### Technologies Used

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
